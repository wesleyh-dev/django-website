# django-website
This is the first website that I published to the World Wide Web. It has since been taken down but the code will remain here. 

I was learning and using Django for the backend including several databases. In this repository, though, you will find most of the user-facing code that is free to use for everyone who wants to build their own website! First, I recommend reading the documentation for [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/).
