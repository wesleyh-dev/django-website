# django-website
This is the first website that I published to the World Wide Web. It has since been taken down but the code will remain here. 

Well, the majority of the code is here.

Much of the back-end code is generated with Python scripts using Django and thus not included to protect a little privacy on my end.
In this repository, though, you will find most of the user-facing code that is free to use for everyone who wants to build their own website!
First, I recommend reading the documentation for Python Django.
