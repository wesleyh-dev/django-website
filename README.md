# django-website
This is my personal website. Well, the majority of the code is here.
Much of the back-end code is generated with Python scripts using Django and thus not included to protect a little privacy on my end.
In this repository, though, you will find most of the user-facing code that is free to use for everyone who wants to build their own website!
First, I recommend reading the documentation for Python Django.
